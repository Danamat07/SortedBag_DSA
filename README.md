# SortedBag_DSA
ADT SortedBag â€“ represented with elements of type TComp using a dynamic array, sorted using a relation on the elements.

This project implements a Sorted Bag data structure in C++, which maintains elements in a sorted order based on a given comparison relation. The project includes both short and extended tests, as well as an iterator for traversing the elements.

Files in the Project
  - App.cpp: The main application file that demonstrates the usage of the SortedBag and tests its functionality.
  - ExtendedTest.cpp: Contains extended test cases to verify the correctness and performance of the SortedBag data structure.
  - ExtendedTest.h: Header file for the extended test cases, defining test functions for larger and edge cases.
  - ShortTest.cpp: Contains short test cases to check basic functionality and correctness of the SortedBag.
  - ShortTest.h: Header file for the short test cases, declaring functions to test basic operations on the SortedBag.
  - SortedBag.cpp: The implementation of the SortedBag class, which holds elements in a dynamic array and maintains their sorted order using a relation.
  - SortedBag.h: Header file for the SortedBag class, providing declarations for its methods and attributes.
  - SortedBagIterator.cpp: Contains the implementation of the iterator for the SortedBag, which allows traversing over the elements in a sorted manner.
  - SortedBagIterator.h: Header file for the SortedBagIterator class, defining the interface for iterating through the elements of the SortedBag.

NOTE: The code for this project can be found on the master branch.
